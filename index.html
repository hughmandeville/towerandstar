        Tanya Donovan is the visionary and  force behind TOWER + STAR and its primary singer and songwriter.
        She has performed punk, rockabilly, prog rock and improvisational theatre. She now spends days and 
        nights with her head inside her ancient piano, collaborating with her bandmates to create alt rock with a 
        classical tinge; music about spirit and transformation but not without sex and shadow. She holds a 
        Bachelors of Theatre Arts from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.

        <div class="band_roles">flute &amp; backup vocals</div>
        Hailing from middle America, Amber loves the city and the music within.
        The muse is a bassy beat and she injects fuel into her veins.
        We dance but it's never enough for our Amber.
        Amber sings, plays flute and guitar ... and has dabbled in playing cornet.
        Classically trained, she has read and felt music, but not until she  came to the city in 2008 did she create.
        Current projects include fronting <a href="https://whatpreytell.bandcamp.com">What Prey Tell</a> and running a DIY recording studio.
        She’s dipped her toe into sound design for film and continues endeavoring in sound ...
