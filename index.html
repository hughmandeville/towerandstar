      <b>Amber Dawn Watson</b><br/>
  Hailing from middle America, Amber loves the city and the music within.
  The muse is a bassy beat and she injects fuel into her veins.
  We dance but it's never enough for our Amber.
  Amber sings, plays flute and guitar ... and has dabbled in playing cornet.
  Classically trained, she has read and felt music, but not until she  came to the city in 2008 did she create.
  Current projects include fronting <a href="https://whatpreytell.bandcamp.com">What Prey Tell</a> and running a DIY recording studio.
  She’s dipped her toe into sound design for film and continues endeavoring in sound ...

      <b>Alain Anthony Salvo</b><br/>
      Anthony resides in Bellville New Jersey and is the only member of the band not hanging in Brooklyn. 
      He’s into Rock, Heavy Progressive, Progressive Metal, Alternative Rock, Classic Rock and Blues and has

      prog rock band <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ninthparadigm">Ninth Paradigm</a>.

      <b>Tanya Donovan</b><br/>
      Tanya Donovan is the creator, writer and concept diva of TOWER + STAR.
      She has dabbled in improvisation, punk, rockabilly and prog rock and is now in full force writing music and lyrics and collaborating with her very talented bandmates to create rock fusion with a classical tinge...in a spiritual light...but not without sex and shadow.
      Tanya plays piano and sings for this band and is stumbling towards learning to play (one of Amber’s) cornets - in case the band should need a brassy solo one day.
      She holds a Bachelors of Theatre Arts from New York University.
      Every song she writes aims to inspire self-reflection &amp; transmutation, from Tower to Star.
